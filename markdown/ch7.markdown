Hanging a picture on the wall, it is sometimes hard to get it
straight.  You make an adjustment, step back, evaluate the picture's
horizontality, and repeat.  This is a process of optimization: we're
changing the angle of the portrait until it satisfies our
demand---that it should be straight.

In mathematics, our demand is called a "cost function", and the angle
of the portrait the "parameter".  In a typical optimization problem,
we vary the parameters until the cost function is minimized.

Consider, e.g., the shifted parabola, $f(x) = (x - 3)**2$.  We know
that this function has a minimum at 3, because we can calculate the
derivative, set it to zero, and see that $2 (x - 3) = 0$, i.e.  $x =
3$.

But, if this function were much more complicated (e.g., was an
expression with many terms, had multiple points of zero derivative,
contained non-linearities, or was dependent on more variables), using
a hand calculation would become arduous.

You can think of the cost function as representing a landscape, where we
are trying to find the lowest point.  That analogy immediately
highlights one of the hard parts of this problem: if you are standing
in any valley, with mountains surrounding you, how do you know whether
you are in the lowest valley, or whether the valley is perhaps
surrounded by *even taller* mountains?  In optimization parlance: how
do you know whether you are trapped in a *local
minimum*?  Most of the optimization algorithms available make some
attempt to address the issue[^line_search].

[^line_search]: Optimization algorithms handle this issue in various
                ways, but two common approaches are line searches and
                trust regions.  With a *line search*, you try to find
                the cost function minimum along a specific dimension,
                and then successively attempt the same along the
                others.  With *trust regions*, we move our guess for
                the minimum in the direction we expect it to be; if we
                are indeed approaching the minimum as expected, we
                repeat the procedure with increased confidence.  If
                not, we lower our confidence and search a wider area.


There are many different optimization algorithms to choose from.  You
get to choose whether your cost function takes a scalar or a vector as
input (i.e., do you have one or multiple parameters to optimize?).
There are those that require the cost function gradient to be given
and those that automatically estimate it.  Some only search for
parameters in a given area (*constrained optimization*), and others
examine the entire parameter space.

In the rest of this chapter, we are going to use SciPy's `optimize`
module to align two images, using the method described in the papers:

* Pluim et al., Image registration by maximization of combined mutual
  information and gradient information, IEEE Transactions on Medical
  Imaging, 19(8) 2000

and

* Pluim et al., Mutual-Information-Based Registration of Medical
  Images: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 22(8) 2003

Applications of image alignment or *registration* include panorama
stitching, combination of multi-modal brain scans, super-resolution
imaging, and, in astronomy, object denoising through the combination
of multiple exposures.

We start, now, by setting up our plotting environment:

```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('style/elegant.mplstyle')
```

Correlation-based image alignment depends on detecting the similarity between
two images at various levels of alignment. We can then "jiggle" the images, and
see whether jiggling them in one direction or another improves the similarity.
By doing this repeatedly, we can try to find the correct alignment.

There are a few problems with the approach as we've just described it, but
we'll deal with the first one: how do you define "image similarity"? One metric
is the *normalized mutual information*, or NMI, which measures how easy it
would be to predict a pixel value of one image given the value of the
corresponding pixel in the other. This measure was defined in the paper:

* Studholme, C., Hill, D.L.G., Hawkes, D.J.: An Overlap Invariant Entropy
  Measure of 3D Medical Image Alignment. Patt. Rec. 32, 71â€“86 (1999)

Let's start with the definition of NMI:

$$
I(X, Y) = \frac{H(X) + H(Y)}{H(X, Y)},
$$

where $H(X)$ is the *entropy* of $X$, and $H(X, Y)$ is the joint entropy of $X$
and $Y$. (See Chapter 5 for a more in-depth discussion of entropy.)

```python
import numpy as np

from scipy.stats import entropy
from scipy import optimize
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

from skimage import transform
from skimage.util import random_noise


def normalized_mutual_information(A, B):
    """Compute the normalized mutual information.

    The normalized mutual information is given by:

                H(A) + H(B)
      Y(A, B) = -----------
                  H(A, B)

    where H(X) is the entropy ``- sum(x log x) for x in X``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A, B : ndarray
        Images to be registered.

    Returns
    -------
    nmi : float
        The normalized mutual information between the two arrays, computed at a
        granularity of 100 bins per axis (10,000 bins total).
    """
    hist, bin_edges = np.histogramdd([np.ravel(A), np.ravel(B)], bins=100)
    hist /= np.sum(hist)

    H_A = entropy(np.sum(hist, axis=0))
    H_B = entropy(np.sum(hist, axis=1))
    H_AB = entropy(np.ravel(hist))

    return (H_A + H_B) / H_AB
```

With this, we can already check whether two images are aligned:

```python
# TODO: show NMI values for images perfectly aligned, slightly off, and very
# off alignment
```

This is the crux of optimization: define a function to optimize (in this case,
the NMI of two images for a given offset value), optimize it, and apply the
resulting parameter set (in this case, align the images with the found offset):

```python
# TODO: start with a ludicrously close offset, so that there's no local minima,
# then apply scipy.optimize to find the correct offset (0)
```

Unfortunately, this brings us to the principal difficulty of this kind of
alignment: sometimes, the NMI has to get worse before it gets better. Have a
look at the NMI value as we slide the same image past itself. The perfect
alignment, of course, is an offset of 0:

```python
# TODO: plot NMI for many offset values along the column axis.
```

As you can see, if you start out with an offset value of , when you jiggle the
offset, the NMI will always get worse. You might then erroneously conclude that
you are done with the alignment, when in fact you are quite a ways off.

The common solution to this problem is to smooth or downscale the images, which
has the dual result of smoothing the objective function. Have a look at the
same plot, after having smoothed the images with a Gaussian filter:

```python
# TODO: smooth image and repeat above plot
```

Therefore, modern alignment software uses what's called a *Gaussian pyramid*,
which is a list of progressively lower resolution versions of the same image.
We can the align the lower resolution (blurrier) images first, to get an
approximate alignment, and then progressively refine the alignment with sharper
images.

```python
# TODO: ab initio implementation of Gaussian pyramid
```

Let's see how the 1D alignment looks along that pyramid:

```python
# TODO: plot NMI for many offset values for each level of the pyramid
```

Now that we have that working, let's try a real alignment, with three
parameters: rotation, translation in the row dimension, and translation in the
column dimension:

```python
from skimage import transform

def build_tf(param):
    r, tx, ty = param
    return transform.SimilarityTransform(rotation=r,
                                         translation=(tx, ty))


def cost_nmi(param, X, Y):
    transformation = build_tf(param)
    Y_prime = transform.warp(Y, transformation, order=3)
    return -normalized_mutual_information(X, Y_prime)


# TODO: Generalize this for N-d
def align(A, B, cost=cost_nmi):
    pyramid_A = transform.pyramid_gaussian(A, downscale=2, max_layer=7)
    pyramid_B = transform.pyramid_gaussian(B, downscale=2, max_layer=7)
    image_pairs = list(zip(pyramid_A, pyramid_B))
    n_levels = len(image_pairs)

    p = np.zeros(3)

    for n, (X, Y) in zip(range(n_levels, 0, -1),
                         reversed(list(image_pairs))):
        p[1:] *= 2

        res = optimize.minimize(cost,
                                p,
                                args=(X, Y),
                                method='Powell')
        p = res.x

        print('Pyramid level %i' % n)
        print('Angle:', np.rad2deg(res.x[0]))
        print('Offset:', res.x[1:] * 2 ** n)
        print('Cost function:', res.fun)
        print('')

    return build_tf(p)
```

```python
from skimage import data, transform, color

img0 = color.rgb2gray(data.astronaut())
theta = 40
img1 = transform.rotate(img0, theta)
img1 = random_noise(img1, mode='gaussian', seed=0, mean=0, var=1e-3)

tf = align(img0, img1)
corrected = transform.warp(img1, tf, order=3)


f, (ax0, ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 3)
ax0.imshow(img0, cmap='gray')
ax0.set_title('Input image')
ax1.imshow(img1, cmap='gray')
ax1.set_title('Transformed image + noise')
ax2.imshow(corrected, cmap='gray')
ax2.set_title('Registered image')
```

Oops! That didn't work at all! Since this is a toy example, we can actually
look at the cost function for *all* possible angles at each level of the
pyramid:

```python
f, ax0 = plt.subplots()
pyr0 = transform.pyramid_gaussian(img0, downscale=2, max_layer=5)
pyr1 = transform.pyramid_gaussian(img1, downscale=2, max_layer=5)
image_pairs = list(zip(pyr0, pyr1))
n_levels = len(image_pairs)
angles = np.linspace(-theta - 180, -theta + 180, 201)
for n, (X, Y) in zip(range(n_levels, 0, -1),
                     reversed(list(image_pairs))):
    costs = np.array([-normalized_mutual_information(X,
                                                     transform.rotate(Y, angle))
                      for angle in angles])
    costs = (costs - np.min(costs)) / (np.max(costs) - np.min(costs))
    ax0.plot(angles, costs, label='level %i' % n)
ax0.set_title('Cost function around angle of interest')
ax0.set_xlabel('Angle')
ax0.set_ylabel('Cost')
ax0.legend(loc='lower right', frameon=True, framealpha=0.9)

plt.show()
```

Thus we can see that the mutual information fails dramatically at the
higher (low-resolution) pyramid levels, while it is virtually flat
at the lower (high-resolution) levels, except for a narrow region around the true
transformation angle! If you start with a relatively faraway angle,
you have no hope of recovering the true transformation.

In their 2000 paper, Pluim *et al.* showed that you can improve the properties
of the objective function by adding *gradient* information to the NMI metric.
Let's try it here to see if we can improve our alignment:

```python
def gradient(image, sigma=1):
    gaussian_filtered = ndi.gaussian_filter(image, sigma=sigma,
                                            mode='constant', cval=0)
    return np.gradient(gaussian_filtered)


def gradient_norm(g):
    return np.linalg.norm(g, axis=-1)


def gradient_similarity(A, B, sigma=1, scale=True):
    """For each pixel, calculate the angle between the gradients of A & B.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A, B : ndarray
        Images.
    sigma : float
        Sigma for the Gaussian filter, used to calculate the image gradient.

    Notes
    -----
    In multi-modal images, gradients may often be similar but point
    in opposite directions.  This weighting function compensates for
    that by mapping both 0 and pi to 1.

    Different imaging modalities can highlight different structures.  We
    are only interested in edges that occur in both images, so we scale the
    similarity by the minimum of the two gradients.

    """
    g_A = np.dstack(gradient(A, sigma=sigma))
    g_B = np.dstack(gradient(B, sigma=sigma))

    mag_g_A = gradient_norm(g_A)
    mag_g_B = gradient_norm(g_B)

    alpha = np.arccos(np.sum(g_A * g_B, axis=-1) /
                        (mag_g_A * mag_g_B))

    # Transform the alpha so that gradients that point in opposite directions
    # count as the same angle
    w = (np.cos(2 * alpha) + 1) / 2

    w[np.isclose(mag_g_A, 0)] = 0
    w[np.isclose(mag_g_B, 0)] = 0

    return w * np.minimum(mag_g_A, mag_g_B)


def alignment(A, B, sigma=1.5):
    I = normalized_mutual_information(A, B)
    G = np.sum(gradient_similarity(A, B, sigma=sigma))

    return I * G


```

Next, we use those functions to align the same image:

```python
from skimage import data, transform, color

img0 = transform.rescale(color.rgb2gray(data.astronaut()), 0.3)

theta = 40
img1 = transform.rotate(img0, theta)
img1 = random_noise(img1, mode='gaussian', seed=0, mean=0, var=1e-3)

def cost_alignment(param, X, Y):
    transformation = build_tf(param)
    Y_prime = transform.warp(Y, transformation, order=3)
    return -alignment(X, Y_prime)


tf = align(img0, img1, cost=cost_alignment)
corrected = transform.warp(img1, tf, order=3)


f, (ax0, ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 3)
ax0.imshow(img0, cmap='gray')
ax0.set_title('Input image')
ax1.imshow(img1, cmap='gray')
ax1.set_title('Transformed image + noise')
ax2.imshow(corrected, cmap='gray')
ax2.set_title('Registered image')
```

Success! Let's look at the objective function profile:

```python
print('Calculating cost function profile...')
f, ax0 = plt.subplots()
pyr0 = transform.pyramid_gaussian(img0, downscale=2, max_layer=5)
pyr1 = transform.pyramid_gaussian(img1, downscale=2, max_layer=5)
image_pairs = list(zip(pyr0, pyr1))
n_levels = len(image_pairs)
angles = np.linspace(-theta - 180, -theta + 180, 201)
for n, (X, Y) in zip(range(n_levels, 0, -1),
                     reversed(list(image_pairs))):
    costs = np.array([-alignment(X, transform.rotate(Y, angle))
                      for angle in angles])
    costs = (costs - np.min(costs)) / (np.max(costs) - np.min(costs))
    ax0.plot(angles, costs, label='level %i' % n)
ax0.set_title('Cost function around angle of interest')
ax0.set_xlabel('Angle')
ax0.set_ylabel('Cost')
ax0.legend(loc='lower right')

plt.show()
```

As you can see, it's much more funnel-shaped than the NMI. It's easy to see why
progressive optimization of Pluim's function at decreasing levels of the
pyramid would result in the correct alignment.
